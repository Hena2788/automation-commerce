## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### 🧪 Run All Tests

```bash
pytest
```

### 🧪 Run Tests with HTML Report

```bash
pytest --html=reports/report.html
```

### ⚡ Run Tests in Parallel

```bash
pytest -n auto
```

### 📊 Run with Allure Reporting

1. Run tests with Allure data generation:

```bash
pytest --alluredir=reports/allure-results
```

2. Generate and open the Allure report:

```bash
allure serve reports/allure-results
```

## 📘 Excel Data-Driven Testing

Use the `openpyxl` package to read and write test data from `.xlsx` files.
Utility functions can be added in `utils/excel_reader.py`.

## 🛠️ Pytest.ini (Example)

```ini
[pytest]
addopts = -v --capture=tee-sys
testpaths = tests
```
